# House Price Prediction

We have analyzed a house price predication dataset for finding out price of house on different parameters. You will do Exploratory Data Analysis, split the training and testing data, Model Evaluation and Predictions.

## Problem Statement

A real state agents want the help to predict the house price for regions in the USA. He gave you the dataset to work on and you decided to use Linear Regressioon Model. Create a model which will help him to estimate of what the house would sell for.

Dataset contains 21 columns and 21613 rows with CSV extension. The data contains the following columns :

- id - Primary Unique Key
- date - Date when the property was bought
- price - This is the output variable wherein we need to find out the prices
- bedrooms - number of bedrooms in the house
- bathrooms
- sqft_living - square feet living
- sqft_lot
- floors - number of floors in the building
- waterfront -
- view
- condition
- grade
- sqft_above - square feet above
- sqft_basement - square feet basement area
- yr_built - when the building was built
- yr_renovated - renovated year
- ted
- zipcode
- lat - latitude
- long - longitude
- sqft_living15
- sqft_lot15

## Install

This project requires Python and the following Python libraries installed:

- NumPy
- Pandas
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a Jupyter Notebook

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the Anaconda distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included.

## Code

Template code is provided in the House_Price_Prediction.ipynb notebook file. You will also be required to use the included kc_house_data.csv dataset file to complete your work. While some code has already been implemented to get you started, you will need to implement additional functionality when requested to successfully complete the project.

## Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```
 ipython notebook House_Price_Prediction.ipynb
```

or

```
jupyter notebook boston_housing.ipynb
```

This will open the Jupyter Notebook software and project file in your browser.
